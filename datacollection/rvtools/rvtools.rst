Analyzing RVTools Data
-------

Overview
--------

RVTools is a free Windows .NET application which uses the VI SDK to collect information about virtual machines and ESXi hosts. RVTools is capable of exporting a complete inventory of a vSphere environment along with point-in-time utilization data.

.. note::

	While RVTools only supports VMware environments, similar reports can be generated for other hypervisors using alternate tools.

	For Hyper-V, see `HyperVTools <https://uglyvpn.com/2017/06/hypervtools-v1-8-released-with-logon-as-local-user/>`_.

	For XenServer, `export Resource Data <https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xencenter/6-5/xs-xc-pools/xs-xc-pools-export-data.html>`_ using XenCenter.

Running RVTools
---------------

Download the `RVTools Installer <https://www.robware.net/rvtools/download/>`_.

Launch the RVTools Installer and complete the installation wizard.

Launch RVTools and provide the following:

- vCenter IP Address/FQDN
- Username with read access to all vCenter resources
- Password

RVTools will collect a complete inventory and display on screen.

Select a directory and click **Save**.

Basic Analysis Tips
-------------------

A standard RVTools export is comprised of many tabs, including vInfo, vCPU, vMemory, vDisks, vPartitions, vHosts, vNetwork, vCD, vFloppy, etc. As a matter of preference, non-essential tabs can be hidden or deleted.

Similarly, each tab contains many non-essential columns that can be hidden or deleted. The remainder of this guide will focus on the essential data, with additional data already removed.

Separate multiple virtual clusters into separate workloads for sizing purposes. Separate clusters may continue to be separate environments running on Nutanix. Even in a scenario where multiple clusters are being consolidated, gathering sizing information separately will allow you to right-size for things like vCPU:pCore ratio.

Add range data on each tab into a table to easily sort and filter. Select the desired tab in Excel and click **Insert > Table**. Ensure **My table has headers** is selected and click **OK**.

.. figure:: images/3.png

The information most relevant to sizing can be extracted from three tabs:

- vInfo
- vPartition
- vHost

removing/hiding unnecessary columns (config status, DNS name, heartbeat, etc.)
pay attention to description and annotation fields - helpful in identifying MC databases
add to table
separate clusters
MB is actually MiB - so divide by 1024
divide up into different workloads based on DR requirements

RVTools - vInfo, vPartition, and vHost tabs - call our WHY we would use vPartion (thick vs. thin provisioned disks) and vHost (data point of CPU consolidation)
	- recognizing thick vdisks (comparing provisioned MB and in User MB on vInfo tab)
	- anecdotal or additional information on CPU utilization to achieve greater vCPU;pCore ratios
- ignoring powered off or template VMs when sizing compute

vInfo
-----

**vInfo** provides a summary of all VMs and their core specifications, including vCPUs, Memory, Provisioned Storage, Host, Cluster, and more.

Open your RVTools spreadsheet and, as previously covered, create a table in Excel from the **vInfo** tab.

.. figure:: images/4.png

Next, in the **Cluster** column, select the **Filter** icon and select the desired cluster.

.. figure:: images/5.png

**Cluster** - Cluster2

In the **Template** column, select the **Filter** icon and select **False**. This will filter out vCPU and Memory related to VMs that will never be powered on.

.. note::

	You should perform a quick filter of **poweredOff** VMs in the **Powerstate** to determine how many powered off VMs there are in the cluster. Typically a few powered off VMs will have negligible impact on the sizing, but if there are many powered off VMs it is worth performing additional discovery with the customer.

	*Do they plan to power these VMs on at any point?* If yes, include the VMs from both a vCPU, memory, and storage perspective in your sizing.

	*Are they simply templates not flagged as templates?* If yes, the VMs don't need to count towards vCPUs and memory, but you should still account for storage.

	*Are these VMs not going to be migrated to Nutanix?* If yes, they can be filtered out of the sizing analysis entirely.

	**Using the "Import RVTools" feature within Nutanix Sizer will ignore ALL PoweredOff VMs entirely. If using this feature for simple environments it is critical to manually account for any powered off VMs.**

.. note::

	You can also filter against the **CPUs** column for VMs with > 8 vCPUs to identify any potential mission critical workloads that should be flagged and sized as a separate workload. The reason for sizing these VMs separately is so Sizer can properly account for differences in vCPU:pCore ratio between general server workloads and workloads such as mission critical databases. Alternatively, these VMs may be Software Defined Storage controllers (e.g. Nutanix CVMs) that can be eliminated from the RVTools analysis.

	The **Description** or **Annotation** columns may provide additional information, but the best course of action is to follow-up with the customer to determine if additional care and attention should be paid to these VMs.

Select the **VM** column to determine the total number of VMs in the cluster. The total number of VMs will be equal to the **Count** value minus 1 (due to the header).

.. figure:: images/6.png

**Total VMs** - 685

Select the **CPUs** column to determine the **Sum** of all vCPUs in the cluster.

.. figure:: images/7.png

**Total vCPUs** - 2248

Select the **Memory** column to determine the **Sum** of all RAM assigned to VMs in the cluster. Divide by 1024 to calculate the amount of RAM in GiB.

.. figure:: images/8.png

.. note::

	Despite vCenter and RVTools displaying values labeled MB, GB, etc., they are actually Base 2 MiB, GiB, etc. **To properly convert between units, multiple or divide by 1024.**

**Total Memory** - 8812468 MiB / 1024 = 8606 GiB

**Provisioned MB** represents the total storage space, in MiB, committed to a virtual machine across all datastores. **In Use MB** represents storage in use, in MiBs, used by this virtual machine on all datastores. However this **In Use** value isn't typically useful for sizing as many environments utilize Thick Provisioned virtual disks, meaning all provisioned space is allocated up front.

.. figure:: images/9.png

Use of Thick Provisioned virtual disks can quickly be determined via comparison of the **Provisioned MB** and **In Use MB** sums, similar or identical values indicate the use of Thick Provisioned disks. The **vDisk** tab also has a **Thin** column which provides a True/False value for each virtual disk.

.. note::

	It is still worth noting the provisioned storage in an environment. Even though we typically size based on storage actually being utilized, the prospect we have additional factors impacting the available capacity required for a proposed solution.

vPartition
----------

**vPartition** provides in-guest storage utilization data provided by VMware Tools.

.. note::

	VMware Tools is required to provide **vPartition** data. The **vTools** tab can be used to identify any VMs that do not have VMware Tools installed.

	VMs do not need to be powered on to provide **vPartition** data. If a VM is powered off, the host will provide the storage utilization data from when the VM was last powered on.

Create a table in Excel from the **vPartition** tab.

Next, in the **Cluster** column, select the **Filter** icon and select the desired cluster.

**Cluster** - **Cluster2**

Select the **Consumed MB** column to determine the **Sum** of all storage currently used in the cluster. Divide by 1024 to calculate the amount in GiB. Divide again by 1024 to calculate the amount in TiB.

.. figure:: images/10.png

**In-Guest Consumed Storage** - 77341279 MiB / 1024 / 1024 = **73.8 TiB**

It is also important to factor in the storage requirement for swap files used for memory oversubscription. This additional amount of capacity should equal the amount of memory provisioned for VM workloads.

**Total Workload Storage** - 73.8TiB + (8606GiB / 1024) = **82.2TiB**

vHost
-----

**vHost** provides details regarding the compute hosts in the cluster, including CPUs, memory, vendor, and model.

Create a table in Excel from the **vHost** tab.

Next, in the **Cluster** column, select the **Filter** icon and select the desired cluster.

**Cluster** - **Cluster2**

.. note::

	**vHost** provides **CPU Usage %** and **Memory Usage %** for each host. This data is collected at the point in time that RVTools was run, and is in no way a historical representation of utilization. It should therefore not factor into sizing.

	If a customer can provide additional anecdotal (peak CPU utilization doesn't exceed X%) or historical performance monitoring data, these can be factored in.

	Memory utilization is less relevant, as we size based on the amount of RAM provisioned to VMs with the assumption that memory is not being overcomitted.

Select the **# Cores** column to determine the **Sum** of all physical CPU cores (**pCores**) in the cluster.

.. figure:: images/11.png

**Total pCores** - **352**

.. note::

	Assuming the existing cluster is sized for N+1 availability, you may want to subtract 1 host worth of pCores from the **Total pCores** value. In this example, the total number of cores required to run the workload would be 336 Cores, rather than 352 Cores (each host has a total of 16 cores). This will have little impact for larger cluster sizes, but can make a dramatic difference in the vCPU:pCore ratio for clusters with a smaller number of hosts.

To calculate **vCPU:pCore Ratio**, divide the **Total vCPUs** by the **Total pCores**.

**vCPU:pCore Ratio** - 2248 / 352 = **6.4:1**

.. note::

	Common vCPU\:pCore ratios for general server virtualization typically range from 3:1-6:1.

	If the calculated ratio falls below this range, first perform some additional discovery with the customer regarding CPU utilization. If they agree they are currently under-utilizing CPU in their existing environment (or have additional historical monitoring data that shows this), you can justify using a higher, assumed ratio.

	Sizer currently defaults to a 6:1 vCPU:pCore ratio for Server Virtulization workloads. This ratio is not a hard standard. Always start by analyzing the data available.

Optionally, comparing existing **CPU Model** to targeted CPU model can also be used to increase vCPU:pCore ratio. Newer CPU models are capable of providing incrementally higher performance from a single core compared to previous generations, often even at lower clock speeds. This approach sees the most significant returns when comparing to CPUs that are several generations old.

Using a common CPU benchmark, such as the `Passmark Single Thread Benchmark <https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html>`_, you can determine how much additional performance to expect on a per core basis.

The Intel Xeon E5-2680v1 processor has a Passmark Single Thread score of 1657.

Hypothetically, we will target the Intel Xeon Gold 6130 processor, which has a Passmark Single Thread score of 1952.

1952 / 1657 = **1.18x greater per core performance compared to the existing CPU model.**

**Adjusted vCPU:pCore Ratio** - 6.4:1 * 1.18 = **7.5:1**

The collected values can now be summarized and used as Sizer inputs.
